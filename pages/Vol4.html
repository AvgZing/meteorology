    Transferring Energy on Earth</h2>
    <p>You will now learn how energy is transferred on Earth between the land, water, and atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Energy is transferred on Earth through convection, radiation, conduction, and evaporation.<h2>
         <p>Conduction is the transfer of heat between two touching bodies. Convection is the transfer of heat throughout a substance. Radiation and evaporation are basic terms that you should already know.</p>
         <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<blockquote>Land and water transfer energy to the atmosphere. The air masses sink from the atmosphere, come in contact with the warmer land and water, and that air gets heated up through conduction. That warmer air then heats up the air around it through convection. In addition, the land and water radiate thermal infrared energy, and some of that energy is absorbed by the atmosphere.</blockquote>
    <h3>Land</h3>
         <p>Since the water cools down slower than the land, it can be warmer than land at some points, so the oceans and seas transfer water to the land through convection. The land is also heated up by its core, but that's not important here because it only heats it up by a little bit. The land is also heated up by the sun's rays, something which the atmosphere's ozone layer protects us from.</p>
    <h3>Water</h3>
         <blockquote>Since land heats up faster than water, the land transfers heat to the water through convection. The water is also heated up by the sun's rays. The atmosphere's ozone layer protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. </blockquote>
