<h3>Setting up a command</h3>
Using commands in a plugin enchants your Plugin! Commands can automatically and easily do things for you!
<blockquote>Insert these "use" statements if you are using commands:</blockquote>
<pre><code>// Command
use pocketmine\command\Command;

// Person who does command
use pocketmine\command\CommandSender;</code></pre>
<blockquote>To setup the command we use a public function! Layout:</blockquote>
<pre><code>public function onCommand(CommandSender $sender,Command $cmd,$label,array $args){
}</code></pre> It may be long for a function, but thats how you're gonna make commands!
<blockquote>After Public Function onCommand():</blockquote>

<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){ //In this case, we will make the command "/test"
     $sender->sendMessage("This is a Test");</code></pre> Explanation: In the scenario above, if the command "/test" is issued, the server will send a message to the player who executed this Command! Congratulations on your first "if" statement! These
are very important in PHP!<br>

               $sender->sendMessage("This Is A Test!");
          }
          return true;
     }
}</code></pre> The "return true" statement goes AFTER the if brackets "{" and "}" So when some one does /test they get a message "This is a test!" <br> Is this too boring for you? Wanna make it EVEN BETTER?

<blockquote>This is how you can make the command "/test" a LOT better! Now, when the player issues a command, he/she will recieve 4 steak!</blockquote>
<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,2)); //364 = Item ID Value (in this case, 364 is steak)
     $sender->sendMessage(TextFormat::BOLD."You have just recieved 4 steak!");
}
return true;</code></pre> This command lets you get four steaks! This shows you almost how powerful commands can be, but there is a LOT more! Unfortunately, something is not right! What would happen if the CONSOLE was the command sender? How do we prevent
the Console?
<br><br>
<blockquote>To prevent the situation above we are going to use an if statement including "instanceof" </blockquote>

<pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){ // Basically this checks if the Command Sender is NOT a player
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!"); // For Console Command Sender
     }else{ //if command sender is not a CONSOLE
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,4));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved 4 steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> This handy dandy chunk of code will make sure that your server does not crash when it tries to give the console 4 steak (which it can no longer do).
