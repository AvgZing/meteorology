    TORNADOES!</h2>
    <p>In this section, you will learn all about tornadoes! We will even investigate a few myths and prove them true or false.</p>
<h3>How does a tornado form, and where?</h3>
<blockquote>We do not know for sure how a tornado forms, but we speculate that:</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Most tornadoes form from thunderstorms</li>
    <li>Moist, warm air and cold air should meet up</li>
    <li>The meeting up of these two air temperatures creates an instability in the atmosphere</li>
    <li>In the lower atmosphere, an invisible spinning effect is created, after wind direction and wind speed change</li>
    <li>Rising air tilts the spinning effect from horizontal to vertical, extending through most of the storm</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>In the United States, tornadoes tend to form in the Great Plains (found near central USA), and a part of florida bordering the Gulf of Mexico. The area in the Great Plains of Central USA is known as Tornado Alley where cold air from Canada meets the warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. On average nine tornadoes occur each year in Oklahoma and Texas (per 10,000 square miles).</blockquote>
    <h3>Wanna know EVEN more? Arguments.</h3>
    Great ! Now that we know how to do "basic" commands, let's make the command <i>even better</i> by allowing the user to choose how many steaks he wants !<br>
    We'll take a look at a variable that we added without knowing what it was... I talk about the <code>$args</code> variable!<br>
    It basicly stores every single arguments you use in an array.<br>
    But how is it stored? Like this: <pre><code>/command &lt;$args[0]&gt; &lt;$args[1]&gt; &lt;$args[2]&gt; &lt;$args[3]&gt; ...</code></pre>
    Warning: Arrays always starts from 0 !<br>
    Let's apply this to our code:<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0])); // We choose the first argument as the count !
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved". count($args[0]) . " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    As you can see, now we can use the /test &lt;steaks number&gt; and it will give us the number of steaks we want!<br>
    But wait, what if the user doesn't enter the argument? The command won't work !<br>
    To solve that issue, we need to add a parser to check if no argument "0" was entered, and if that's the case, "creating" it.<br>
    We'll use function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php"><code>isset</code></a> which allows us to check if a variable is defined.<br>
    Let's what this give use in our code !<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          if(!isset($args[0])) { // Check if argument 0 isn't defined.
                $args[0] = 4; // Defining $args[0] with value 4
          }
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0]));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved" .count($args[0]). " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    Seems already better !<br>
    But what if the user don't enter a number? And even if it's a number, what if it's negative?<br>
    We also need to check this in our code! We will use a new function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-int.php"><code>is_int</code></a> which will allow us to check if a variable is an integer.<br>
    
    <pre><code>if($cmd->getName() == "test"){
     if(!$sender instanceof Player){
          $sender->sendMessage("This Command Only Works for players! Please perform this command IN GAME!");
     }else{
          if(!isset($args[0]) or (is_int($args[0]) and $args[0] > 0)) { // Check if argument 0 is an integer and is more than 0.
                $args[0] = 4; // Defining $args[0] with value 4
          }
          $sender->getInventory()->addItem(Item::get(364,0,$args[0]));
          $sender->sendMessage("You have just recieved" .count($args[0]). " steak!");
     }
}
return true;</code></pre> 
    And that's it ! You made your first command with arguments !
