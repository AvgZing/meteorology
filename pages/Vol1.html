<h3>What is a Blizzard?</h3>
<pre><code>
A Blizzard is a severe Snow Storm. The winds are sustained at a speed of 35 miles per hour at a minimum, and it must last for at least 3 hours. 
The visibility must be a maximum of 0.25 miles in order for it to be a Blizzard as opposed to a Snow Storm. 
It is more likely for whiteout conditions to occur in a Blizzard, and less likely for there to be a whiteout in a regular Snow Storm.
