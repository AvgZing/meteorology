    Severe Storm Project: <br>Blizzards </h2>
<p>In this part of the course, you will learn what Blizzards are, how Blizzards form, where Blizzards occur, how to prepare for a Blizzard, and what you should/should not do while a Blizzard is occurring..</p>
<h3>What is a Blizzard?</h3>
<pre><code>
A Blizzard is a severe Snow Storm. The winds are sustained at a speed of 35 miles per hour at a minimum, and it must last for at least 3 hours. 
The visibility must be a maximum of 0.25 miles in order for it to be a Blizzard as opposed to a Snow Storm. 
It is more likely for whiteout conditions to occur in a Blizzard, and less likely for there to be a whiteout in a regular Snow Storm.
</code></pre>
<h3>How does a Blizzard form?</h3>
A Blizzard forms when:
	<ul>
		<li>Water vapor in the air has formed clouds</li>
		<li>There is going to be precipitation</li>
		<li>The temperature is cold, both on the ground and in the clouds</li>
		<li>Warm air must be able to rise <b>above</b> the cold air, and that requires adequate lift</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Where do Blizzards occur?</h3>
In North America, Blizzards mainly occur in:
	<pre><code>
The states in Northeastern United States of America
The provinces of Canada
The mountains in Western United States of America.
	</code></pre>
	<h3>Can you prepare for a blizzard? If so, how?</h3>
	Yes, you can prepare for a blizzard. <br>
	Step 1: Make sure that you have the following in your emergency kit:
	<ul>
		<li>Environmentally-safe ice-melting products for walkways. EG: Rock salt</li>
		<li>Small quantities of Sand for improved traction</li>
		<li>Snow shovels and snow-removal equipment</li>
		<li>Dry wood in case power goes out for your fireplace or wood-stove</li>
		<li>Blankets, jackets, and extra clothing</li>
		<li>Wind up radio for the NOAA's Weather broadcast alerts</li>
	</ul>
	Step 2: Make sure that your family's car is prepared by:
	<ul>
		<li>Check key components of your car to make sure it is in top shape, including Antifreeze levels, oil, and the heater.</li>
		<li>Check the brakes for wear and tear. Replace them if damaged</li>
		<li>Replace your tires, preferably with proper winter tires. They should have good treads. In some areas which experience lots of snow, the tires may need chains or studs on the tires.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Covering windows with plastic and insulating walls</li>
		<li>Clean gutters, fix roof-holes, and cut branches that may fall</li>
		<li>Check your roof's maximum capacity for the weight of snow. Cleaning may be needed if the roof cannot hold the weight of the snow from the upcoming blizzard</li>
		<li>Turn off the pipes to avoid frozen pipes or pipes bursting</li>
		<li>Drain your pool and cover it, if you haven't already</li>
